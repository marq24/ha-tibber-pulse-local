        - label: I have prepared DEBUG log output (for technical issues) |
            In most of the cases of a technical error/issue I would have the need to ask for DEBUG log output of the integration. There is a short [tutorial/guide 'How to provide DEBUG log' here](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/blob/master/docs/HA_DEBUG.md)
